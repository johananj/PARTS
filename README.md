# PARTS - PAttern Recognition for Time Series data. 

## What and Why
- PARTS is a pattern recognition toolkit written in python, to quickly evaluate pattern recognition accuracies.
- It is based primarily on the 1DCNN. Something I have immense faith on, when it comes to time-series pattern classification.
- To carry out the evaluation, a series of steps are required: data preparation, training, testing.
- In cases involving feature extraction (instead of raw data), it is carried out live during the training phase, for each batch.
- An example use case can be found in example.ipynb

## TO-DO
- [x] Example python notebook. 
- [x] Include a basic LSTM architecture.
- [ ] Data preparation classes for:
    - [ ] Whisper-normal speech classification using W-TIMIT.
    - [x] Literary-colloquial Tamil speech classification using the Microsoft Dataset.
    - [x] Sleep detection.
